	<h2>WARNING!!! THIS IS IN 3RD PERSON!!!</h2>
	<p>	Teriaki and Andrewazhangki went to the forest today morning. The forest was full of spiders. In fact, it was so filled that they couldn't even walk without stepping on spiders. Also, since there were so many spiders, if they were not looking at were they're going, they would walk right into a spiderweb. The spiders are big spiders, so there were giant, thick webs!</p>
	<p>	Teriaki and Andrewazhangki went to the forest to look for his lost pet spider, but there are so many of them, they couldn't tell which is Andrewazhangki's spider. And, it looks like all of the spiders in the forest is having fun, but Teriaki and Andrewazhangki. No fair! And that's when a weird thing happened. A series of weird things, acctually. Teriaki and Andrewazhangki wasn't looking at where they were headed, so they stepped on a spider.</p> <p>	That spider screamed, and other spiders hurried to build a spider web just in front of them. They were distracted by the crunching sound of the spider crushed by their foot, and that's how the spiders made the nice and thick web for them. They obviously didn't see the web, so they ran right into it.</p> <p>		THE END</p>
