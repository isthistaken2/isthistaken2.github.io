	<h2>WARNING!!! THIS IS IN 3RD PERSON!!!</h2>
	<p>Teriaki and Andrewazhangki went to the forest today morning. The forest was full of spiders. In fact, it was so filled that they couldn't even walk without stepping on spiders. Also, since there were so many spiders, if they were not looking at were they're going, they would walk right into a spiderweb. The spiders are big spiders, so there were giant, thick webs!</p>
